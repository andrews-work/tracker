Hi James, 

We spoke on the phone a few weeks ago about a potential job offer starting early May. On the call you mentioned the role would include: changing the format of incoming invoices so they all have the same format, interacting with clients and assisting them with technical difficulties and the potential to move into a junior developer based role. 

I assumed you were back from your US trip and was wondering if you had the chance to consider this at all. Look forward to hearing from you, feel free to call me - 0478706693

Cheers, 

Andrew
