project scraping:
    - american guy made a web scraper 
        - products from all suppliers into database per supplier
        - read into shopify app database only, search enginge
        - proffesionals can search for products not on website
        - errors:
            - data missing,
            - data duplication
            - inconsisetency of data
            - product size isnt uploaded (if your lucky all sizes show up)
        - assessment:
            - slowly improve outcomes - 30 suppliers
            - the data isnt good enough, 
            - experiement with one website, create scripts/code and then play wtih it and customise it until the data is quality level and data is presented in an appropriate way
            -

source website url - gets data
convert to spreadsheet

website scraping / info / upload into shopify account
excel spreadsheet uploadd into shopify 
subdomain extension - suppliers - shopify is the suppliers subdomain

issue with eric client side - multiple items showing up
    - regular updates
    - clear view of product color/size/


1. scrape data into excel
2. login to shopify
3. upload products into shopify from excel

eriks example - create a better scraping script - sit it ppssible to add missing products, strange skews, dont add made up data
q and a  - test script per website, modify code for every website - 30 suppliers

1. does chatgpt do the job, 
2. write script to update
